# LinkedListandNode
Contains the Assassin game and LinkedList Generic practice

Created using Generic LinkedLists and Generic Nodes

This contains the practice and code for Generic Linked Lists and the game "Assassin"

"Assassin" is basically a battle royale-like game where players will kill off each other until the player with the highest point wins.

In this case, I'm using characters from Infinity War just for fun. Names are in the Assassin.txt file.

The "Assassin" game uses all files except for MorePractice, which is a class reserved for practicing Generic Linked Lists.

- Assassin.java - Data structure for name and skill level
- Assassin.txt - Game file, contains names and skill level (Name, skill level)
- AssassinManager - Handles the game, looks for the next potential victim and recaps the game
- LinkedList.java - Linked List data structure with generics
- Main.java and MorePractice.java - Testing for LinkedList data structure. Uses extends Comparable<E>
- Node.java - Data structure for Generic Node
