# LinkedListandNode
Contains the Assassin game and LinkedList Generic practice

Created using Generic LinkedLists and Generic Nodes

This contains the practice and code for Generic Linked Lists and the game "Assassin"

"Assassin" is basically a battle royale-like game where players will kill off each other until the player with the highest point wins.

In this case, I'm using characters from Infinity War just for fun. Names are in the Assassin.txt file.

The "Assassin" game uses all files except for MorePractice, which is a class reserved for practicing Generic Linked Lists.
